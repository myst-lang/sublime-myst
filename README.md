# Myst syntax highlighting for Sublime Text 3

This package provides syntax highlighting for the [Myst programming language](https://github.com/myst-lang/myst).

# Installation

Since the syntax of Myst is not necessarily well-defined yet, this package has not been published to the main Package Control channel. To install the package, add the repository to Package Control (see the "Add Repository" section at https://packagecontrol.io/docs/usage) with the url https://github.com/myst-lang/sublime-myst.

Once the repository has been added, you should be able to install the package as normal through Package Control. It will be under the name `sublime-myst`.
